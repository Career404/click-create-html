> Anyone who attempted to behead the Hydra found that as soon as one head was cut off, two more heads would emerge from the fresh wound.

This was a spontaneous idea that turned out nicely. One click creates four buttons, clicking them creates for more, and so on. Clicking on boxes all day long!

Written with a different way to track first click on purpose!
